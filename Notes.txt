Talking Points

- Introduce Python
- Introduce Colab 
    - Web environment for Jupyter Notebooks 
    - Variables will be "printed"
- 

- Things to Consider
    - Exceptions
    - Discuss history (who created it, why, when, etc.)

- Review Challenges / expand upon them
- Check compatibility with Colab
